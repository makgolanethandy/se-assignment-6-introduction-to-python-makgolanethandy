# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   
   - Python- One of the most popular programming languages.
   - Features-Free and open source, Community support, standard library, easy to code, easy to read(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-features/).
   - Python is used in data science and data analytics. Numerical computation are done using the library known as Numpy.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   - Search  https://www.python.org/downloads/ on your web browser
   - Select Python version to download
   - Click on Install now
   - Select Customize installation and proceed.
   - Click on the Add Path check box, it will set the Python path automatically on your environmental path
   - Continue until installation is done
   
   - To verify Installation:
      - Open python
      - Write the command :python --version
      - This should return the version of python installed in your computer system
   
   - To set up virtaul environment
      -  OPEN Python and write the below commands:
         - mkdir Myproject
         - cd Myproject
         - python<version>-m venv env e.g python3.8 -m venv env


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   -print ("Hello, World!")

      - print()=outputs data to the console
      - ""(closed quotation)- used to represent text

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   - Data types-
      - Text Type:	str- sequence of charecters enclosed in quotation marks
         - "Hello, World!"
      - Numeric Types:	int, float, -Numbers
         - x = 20
      - Sequence Types:	list- ordered collection of items. Closed in parentheses
         - x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      - Boolean Type:	bool-represent one of the two values
         - x = True
         
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
